/* 
An example is a Cake Shop

Customer => Order a cake
ShopKeeper => Box a cake from the shelf 

=> Store holds the state of your application
=> Cake ordered => Action in redux => describles what happened, 
=> ShopKeeper => Reducer => The shopkeeper who ties and actions and the store together



//ShopKeeper here we go 
const reducer = (state = initiaLState, action) => {
    switch(action.type) {
        case CAKE_ORDERED: 
        return {
            numOfCakes: state.numOfCakes - 1
        }
    }
}

so reducer => Reducer - (previousState, action) => newState

//Three Core Concepts

A store that holds the state of your application
An action that describles what happened in the application -=> dispatching an action 
A reducer which handles the action and decided how to update the state
     



=========Actions=============
The only way your application can interact with the store and it holds info about the redux store

Plain js objects that describes something that happened in the application, 
 => the type property is defined in string constants

 =======Reducers==========
 Specify how the app's state changes in response to actions sent to the store,
 actions only describe what happens but dont describe how the applications state changes

 so its a function that accepts state and action as arguments and returns the next state of the application

 (previousState, action) => newState
/*

===========================Redux Store================================
One store for the whole applciation

Responsiblilites

=> Holds application state

=> Allows access to state via getState()

=> Allows state to be updated via dispatch(action )
// 
=> Registers listeners via subscribe (listener)
